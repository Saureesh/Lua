# Lua
Install an editor, I usually prefer Atom because it is very user friendly and is easy to distinguish codes. You can download it from https://atom.io/.
Install a Framework Love2d from https://love2d.org/.
After opening Atom you should go to settings if windows or preferences if mac, go to packages and choose 'install package'.
Search for 'Love-ide' and install the first one that pops. It helps to run the program in Love2d framework through the editor Atom.
After installing it you should choose 'Add a project folder', open it and create a file with name 'main.lua' and type the code and run . By doing that the game will directly open in Love2d without any 3rd party interference.
